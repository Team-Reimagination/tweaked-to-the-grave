  <h2>Description</h2>
  <b>Tweaked To The Grave</b> is a <b>3D Fixed Camera Shooter</b> where the goal is to chase down the boss of each level and shoot them down as you dodge infinitely generating obstales, with variety in layouts and types of obstacles in question.<br>You play as <b>Seezee553</b>, and a creation of yours, <b>Bob Tweaked</b> has risen from the dead, looking for revenge on you for being left for years. And you must stop it on this (so far) short journey.
  <h2>Inspiration:</h2>
  The game was inspired by Starfox 64, Sonic Advance 1's bosses where you have to run constantly to get close and other things that the team can't remember, but those two are the most prevalent.
  <h2>Time of Development & Its Future:</h2>
  This game started development in late February / early March, right after <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/yege-the-game/976332">"Yege the Game"</a> dropped, so it took a couple months to develop. But it's not the end for this game, as it will eventually be developed into a full release, with a potential kickstarter depending on how things will go in order to possibly get this on Steam. It has tons of potential after all.
  <h2>Notes & Extras:</h2>
  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  - The majority of the characters present in the game are based on real people, so keep that in mind with fan content.
  <br>- The game contains inside jokes that while funny inside the circle may not work so well for everyone else. This will be taken care of in the full release.
  <br>- The majority of the music in this game, in the current state it's in, is all placeholders due to time contraints.
  <br>- If you don't do so well with reaction time, it's most likely not recommended to play the game as the pace can get rather quick.
