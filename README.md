# tweaked to the grave
 im tweaking it ohhhh im tweaking it

there will be a proper readme close to release, but for now, to play this you need Godot 4.4 or never, preferably 4.4 because changing versions has a chance of breaking something. Unlikely with upgrading but very much likely with downgrading

also the codebase is a little messy lmfao

FOR DEVS:
Look into the TODO for now
