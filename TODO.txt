Pause Menu:
 - Non-mouse Support
 - Highlighting for the button and sliders when you're about to select them
 - Kill all noise right when you click the restart button because the sound plays for a split second and it's weird ass
 - Should not be able to pause when game overing (when the fire starts appearing)

Pixel Shader:
 - Weird Gaps
