Pause Menu:
 - Non-mouse Support
 - Highlighting for the button and sliders when you're about to select them
 - Kill all noise right when you click the restart button because the sound plays for a split second and it's weird ass
 - Should not be able to pause when game overing (when the fire starts appearing)

Custom Cursors:
 - Idle and Hand cursors for now

Adventure Mode Select:
 - Difficulty switch sound plays when mouse was used and then enter was pressed when it should not play any stage select sounds

Pixel shader:
 - Weird gaps
 - gotta restart it :sob:
